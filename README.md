# Intent_detection_nlp

- trying to create a all purpose intent classification model which can act as base for several use-cases and when clubbed with different models can be used for varity of chat-bot based applications.
- This is a WIP project and the final notebook will contain the steps and journey right from a basic 'NaiveByes' traditional ML model to, some better performing ML models, Neural Networks and LLMs.
